# Weather-application

The Weather-application will have real-time weather information by utilizing a Weather API. The initial data will display the user's current location. The app is designed to be responsive for both desktop and mobile devices.
The application will also offer optional features, including the ability for the user to forecast weather for up to seven days or 24 hours. Users can view weather data for multiple cities (not more than 7) and save their favorite locations. Additionally, the app offers two themes: day and night, to enhance the user's experience.
Even if the application was originally intended to call the weather APIs, free APIs were expiring after some calls, so I implemented a service that would give me random data. The app is not finished, is a work in progress.

# Project was based on the following technologies and tooling:
- [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.3 with Typescript

- HTML

- SASS 

- Git

- Visual Studio Code

- NG-Bootstrap

Libraries:

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
